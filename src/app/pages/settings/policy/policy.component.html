    We shall respect your online privacy and security.
    You are not obliged to identify yourself or reveal any personal information.
    We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis. If you choose to provide us with personal information, (such as your name, age, date of birth, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit card number) to sign up for a newsletter, participate in a contest, make a donation, participate in forums, blogs or bulletin boards, you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with Radio Rehoboth, that we have taken appropriate steps to protect it, and that Radio Rehoboth will not wilfully disclose your personal information to any third party without first receiving your permission. At the time you are asked to provide personal information we will explain the extent of its use. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply “opt out.” However, normally opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, as in contests.
